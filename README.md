# Qompute.ai Applied Research Project for Scientific Understanding and Advancement 

#### Applied Discrete Combinatorial Calculus and other Advanced Proof of Concepts

## Introduction 

This project represents a small sample of the research corpus from the advanced projects within the Qompute.ai ecosystem 
of research and development. Focused on the fundamental mathematics which ground computational efficiency efforts in all 
applications, this resource is meant to further the understanding and knowledge transfer fundamental discoveries or best 
practices in achieving leading computational capabilities. From quaternionic wavelet operations for lossless dimensional 
reduction and reconstruction to hilbert space creation from arbitrary data inputs, we aim to be the leaders in advanced
applied mathematics for combinatorial calculus in computational science.
